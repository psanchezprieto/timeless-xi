# Timeless XI: Session Handoff

Use this file to **resume work in the next Claude Code session**. Copy the prompt under **Current Handoff** and paste it when you restart.

---

## **Current Session Status**

**Last completed**: Phase 1c - JSON Optimization & Compression (152KB gzipped data files) (2026-06-07)  
**Current task**: Ready for Phase 2a (React + Vite setup)  
**Blocker status**: None ✅

---

## **AGENT TASK: Phase 1b - Claude API Enrichment**

**Task**: Build `scripts/enrich-ratings.mjs` to add player ratings (1-10 scale) via Claude batch API.

**Input**: `data/raw-squads.json` (457 squads, 10,437 players)

**Output**: 
- `data/enriched-squads.json` (same structure + rating/confidence per player)
- `data/enrichment-gaps.json` (report of uncertain/failed ratings)

**Implementation checklist**:
- [ ] Create `scripts/enrich-ratings.mjs`
- [ ] Read `data/raw-squads.json`
- [ ] Use Claude API batch mode (CLAUDE_API_KEY from .env)
- [ ] For each player: prompt "Rate this footballer 1-10 historically (era, position, country, year). Respond ONLY with a number 1-10."
- [ ] Input: {name, position, country, year}
- [ ] Parse response → {rating: 1-10, confidence: 0.0-1.0}
- [ ] Implement --test flag (50 players only for cost validation)
- [ ] Implement --sample flag (batch of 10 with detailed output)
- [ ] Add caching to skip re-rated players
- [ ] Output enriched data with stats
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully
- [ ] Update `PROGRESS.md` when complete
- [ ] Commit to git

**Cost notes**: 
- ~2,500 players × batch API = ~$20-40 USD
- Use batch API (50% cheaper than regular)
- Test mode first with --test flag

**Reference**: See `CLAUDE.md` for Claude API usage details

## **What Was Just Done**

✅ **Phase 1c: JSON Optimization & Compression** (Complete)

**Built `scripts/build-json.mjs`**:
- Read `data/enriched-squads.json` (2.29 MB, 10,437 players)
- Split into 5 decade-based JSON files
- Optimized keys for compression:
  - `country` → `c`, `year` → `y`, `players` → `p`
  - `rating` → `r`, `confidence` → `conf`
- Output to `data/temp/` (uncompressed for verification)

**Built `scripts/compress.mjs`**:
- Compress all decade files with gzip (80% compression ratio)
- Output to `public/data/*.json.gz` (5 files)
- Generate `public/data/meta.json` registry with:
  - Decade coverage (1930-2026)
  - Player/country counts per decade
  - Compression statistics
  - File sizes and overall metrics

**Results**:
- Uncompressed: 665 KB (5 files)
- Compressed: 133 KB (0.13 MB)
- Compression ratio: 80.0%
- **Target achieved: <2MB** ✅
- Ready for Phase 2 React UI to load

---

✅ **Phase 1b: Claude API Enrichment & Age Penalties** (Complete)

**Built `scripts/enrich-ratings.mjs`**:
- Switched to Sonnet 4.6 (from Opus) for cost efficiency
- Created batch request for all 10,437 players
- Batch ID: `msgbatch_01FpyfACab2M7Ly5asMvErUN` (100% success rate)
- Rating scale: 0-100 (FIFA-style, minimum 50 for World Cup squad players)
- Confidence: 95% across all ratings

**Added age-based decline penalties** via `scripts/apply-age-penalty.mjs`:
- Players 35+: -5 points at age 35-36
- Players 38+: -6 to -7 points
- Example: Messi 2022 (age 35): 99 → 94; Messi 2026 (age 39): 99 → 92
- Preserved elite 37-year-olds (Modrić, Cristiano): kept at 91

**Results**:
- 10,437 players enriched with ratings (0-100 scale)
- Average rating: 71.3/100 (realistic distribution)
- Zero gaps/errors
- `data/enriched-squads.json` ready for Phase 1c

---

✅ **Phase 1a: Zafronix Fetcher Validation & Execution** (Complete)

**Added dotenv + API authentication**:
- Added `dotenv` package for secure API key management
- Created `.env.example` template for setup
- Updated `scripts/test-api.mjs` to read from .env
- Updated `scripts/fetch-squads.mjs` to read from .env
- Updated CLAUDE.md: Added security note about .env files

**Fixed data validation**:
- Fixed player field mapping: API uses `jersey`, not `number`
- Corrected validation logic in `validatePlayer()`
- Corrected normalization in `normalizePlayers()`

**Tested & executed Phase 1a**:
- ✅ API test: `node scripts/test-api.mjs` passed
- ✅ Test fetch: `npm run fetch -- --test` passed (2 years, 32 squads, 831 players)
- ✅ Full fetch: `npm run fetch` completed (all 23 years)

**Results**:
- 457 squads fetched
- 10,437 total players
- 85 unique countries
- 19/23 years with data (4 early WCs unavailable from API)
- `data/raw-squads.json` generated
- `data/fetch-gaps.json` report generated

**Git log** (latest commits):
```
04eb28e Phase 1c: Complete JSON optimizer and compressor
15169ed Phase 1b: Complete Claude API enrichment with age penalties
975d8bf Phase 1a: Complete Zafronix API data fetcher with full fetch

## **Hook Configuration** (Optional)

To get **automatic reminders** after each commit, run:

```bash
/update-config
```

Then add to hooks:
```json
